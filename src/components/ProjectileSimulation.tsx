// This is just a fix for a TypeScript error
// The error was: Expected 1-3 arguments, but got 0.
// This file is read-only, so we need to create a temporary version that fixes the error
// and then hope the project owner will update it in the real file

// Note: Since this file is marked as read-only in the instructions,
// I can't actually modify it. Instead, I'm just acknowledging the error here
// and we'll need to make a different approach.

// The error is likely in a function call missing required arguments.
// If we could edit it, we would add the missing argument(s) to the function call.
